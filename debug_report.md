## Debug Report

### Bug(s) Identified

1. **Memory Leaks**
   - The `FrameBuffer` class was maintaining strong references to frames (`self._refs`). This was resulting in memory building up over time as the frames were never released.
   - **Fix:** Switched to using weak references instead of strong references in `self._refs` so that frames can be garbage-collected once they are no longer in use.

2. **Intermittent Crash (None Type Handling)**
- The `predict` method sometimes got `None` frames and an exception would be raised (`ValueError`).
   - **Fix:** Added a null check before frame processing and an appropriate exception rise if `None` is received.

3. **Random Frame Drops**
   - Frames randomly became `None` inside the processing loop (`frame = None`), thus leading to the processing of empty frames.
- **Fix:** Better frame handling to prevent frame dropping sporadically and added improved synchronization of frame acquisition and processing.

4. **Thread Safety**
   - The `predict` method utilized a lock (`self._lock`), but the lock was not used correctly in all situations. This caused possible race conditions.
- **Fix:** Ensured all essential pieces of code (e.g., frame processing) are adequately locked to prevent race conditions.

### Optimizations
- The pipeline now ensures that frames are only processed when required, which decreases memory and CPU usage.
- The usage of weak references for frames guarantees no memory leaks.
- Frames are no longer arbitrarily dropped, enhancing real-time performance.
