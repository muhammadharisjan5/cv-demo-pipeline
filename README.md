# Computer Vision Pipeline

This repository has a real-time computer vision pipeline implemented with OpenCV, FastAPI, and Python. It features a basic object detection model that works on video frames and performs minimal detection.

## Files
- **cv_pipeline.py**: Top-level implementation of the computer vision pipeline.
- **api.py**: FastAPI-based API for interacting with the model.
- **test_cv_pipeline.py**: Unit tests for the pipeline.
- **debug_report.md**: Description of bugs found and bug fixes.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Setup

1. **Install Dependencies:**
